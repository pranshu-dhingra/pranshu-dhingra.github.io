## AI Driven Fraud Case Summarizer
> - This work presents an end-to-end pipeline that transforms structured fraud detection outputs into human-readable case summaries using interpretable machine learning and small language models.
> - We combine XGBoost anomaly classification with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for local interpretability, converting quantitative feature attributions into natural language silver labels.
> - These enriched explanations serve as training signals for a fine-tuned Flan-T5 model, which generates investigation-ready fraud narratives complete with risk assessments and actionable recommendations for fraud analysts.
